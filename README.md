# FishOS
==============
I'm making FishOS: a new operating system with the 16-bit x86 architecture.
So, yeah, feel free to request things and make issues, because it's not that
popular.

As of November of 2024, it outputs:
```
Loading...
[Read from disk success/fail]
```

I am using Assembly, WSL for makefiles and NASM for compiling.
